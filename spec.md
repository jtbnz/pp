I would like to create a mobile web based portal app. There will be users and admins (who are also users), users will be invited via a one time code that can be regenerated by admins. the one time code will grant access to that person for up to five years and codes can be renewed by admins.  Within users we will have Firefighters and Officers, the difference being officers can approve leave requests by firefireghters.

 it will have the following functions:
Calendar
    A shared calenedar that can be viewed in day,week,month views that will show one off events and regular reoccuring events.  any event list will have an option to create that event in your own local mobile phone calendar.   
Notices
    A notice board that will have sticky notices, timed notices so admins can create a notice that has a display from and to date and time.
Leave Request
    Ability to request leave for next training.  This should link to our new attendance system. hosted here https://kiaora.tech/dlb/puke/attendance with the pin 1755 we will need to check the code of this site here https://github.com/jtbnz/dlb and create a plan to allow token based api access if it is not already done that can be impleneted in that project, create this as a seperate md file that I will add to that project. this will enable us  to prepopululate the next muster or multiple upcoming musters that will remain invisible to the attendance users until the day of the muster. so I can request leave for up to the next 3 training nights, any extended leave will need to be enter by an admin. so users will need a status attached to them.  on requesting leave it will sit in a pending state until an officer approves.


Landing page should have a couple of upcoming events. with the first being the next training night. this will be an event in the calendar. usually these are mondays but will be moved to Tuesday if a New zealand Auckland public holiday falls on a monday, we should be able to prepoulate trainings for the next 12 months.  timezone is always New Zealand time and then notices.


Styling should be slick and modern with full use of dynamic interactions

You should add the chrome-dev-tools mcp so you can test as you create. you can also enter the context7 mcp And I will add my api key if required.
